# Craps :game_die: :game_die:

In the “craps” game, a player rolls two six-sided dice.  
The sum of these two dice can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12.  

### Case 1
A sum of 7 or 11 on the first roll causes the player to win.  

### Case 2
A sum of 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll causes the player to lose.  

### Case 3
A sum of anything else (i.e. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) on the first roll causes this value to become known as the “point”.  
The player then rolls the two-dice repeatedly until a roll with a sum of 7 occurs (in which case the player loses) or a roll with a sum equal to the “point” occurs (in which case the player wins).


Finally, this program simulates the above game and asks the player after each game if they would like to play again. The player has to enter ‘y’ or ‘n’ for that purpose.

And remember to enjoy!! Have fun.
